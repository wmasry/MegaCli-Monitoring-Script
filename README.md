# MegaCLI-Monitoring-Script

MEGACLI script to identity devices with media error and report the associated logical drives

# Current Capabilities

• Identify any devices with Media errors.

• Identify the associated OS scsi device name using sgmap.

• Report the associated "Enclosure Name, Device Location, Serial Number, Raw Size ...... etc"

# Limitations

• Further code review is required as the script is currently a functional-draft only 'I stopped further development as I am currently working on other platforms'

• The script provides 1-to-1 relation "currently limited to identify logical drives associated with one physical drives"
